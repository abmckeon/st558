#  **About Me**. 

My name is *Ashlee McKeon* and I am a ~~second~~ first-term student in the Computer Science Department's Data Science Foundations certificate program. I know a small bit of R from self-study, but I am very excited to be in this course and learn a strong foundation in R within a more structured and interactive program.  

A few fun facts about me:  

1.  I do Crossfit in my spare time as my primary hobby. 
2.  I love travel and spending time outdoors hiking.  
    +  My boyfriend and I have a liftime goal to climb all 48 4000ft mountains in New Hampshire. We've tackled 4 so far. 
3.  I have two corgis that I adore. 
4.  I am an Officer and Sleep Scientist for the U.S. Army.    

Here is a picture of a Hynogram. It is a visualization we use to measure human and animal sleep patterns:

## The Purpose of this Blog. 

I will use this blog for school assignments mostly, but will also likely just create some posts on my own to gain more practice with R Markdown syntax.  

Here is the link to my blog [link](https://github.com/abmckeon/st558). You can also email me at abmckeon@ncsu.edu.
