## Blog Post Questions

To date, the coolest thing Iâ€™ve learned about programming in R is
efficiency of how to create plots and tables to summarize data. As a
scientist in my day job, I am looking at how R can directly apply to
making me more effective at my current job in both the immediate and the
long term. The ability to write a block of code as the skeleton for
types of visuals (and numeric summaries) I will often use, and then have
the ability to easily modify that block of code to unique tailor each
plot is really something I am excited to use. An example of the type of
code I am referring to is below.

Secondly, I hate a great time working on Project 1. That was the first
point in the course where I really started to feel fluid in my coding
and saw the building blocks coming together in my skill development.
That was very exciting for me.
