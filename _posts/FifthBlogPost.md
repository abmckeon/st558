## What your current thoughts are in terms of using R for data science - do you think you’ll continue to use R going forward? Why or why not?

I am feeling very positive about what R can do for the current position
I hold and for where I see my career going in the future. So I
definitely plan to continue using it and dedicate myself to refining and
building upon those skills through additional coursework and starting to
apply R more at my job.

## What things are you going to do differently in practice now that you’ve had this course?

I am going to take more time to set up a system for my R and R-studio
work. Something I can use long term and parse my work out by projects. I
want to develop a foundation for allows for a high level of organization
of my work over time where I can easily access it and leverage what I
have done previously.

## What areas of statistics/data science are you thinking about exploring further?

I really want to dive more into creating Shiny presentations. That is a
really exciting capability to me and the work that I do. I do a lot of
merging of complex datasets and modeling, so those are two skills areas
I plan to focus on heavily moving forward.
