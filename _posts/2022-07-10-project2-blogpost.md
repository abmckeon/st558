The main goal of this project was to create predictive models based on data from an online news popularity site. The data includes about two years worth of information regarding Mashable articles. This data is summarized by a set of 61 categorical and quantitative variables that will eventually help us predict the number of shares a Mashable article gets.

Reflection:

I would have made more variables if I had the opportunity to do this project again or do another in the future. This dataset was a bit tricky to work with due to the highly skewed spread of the numeric variables, which made making plots that were meaningful as easy to read and interpret challenging. Thus, I think taking more time to pre-process the data to get additional metrics that may have been more friendly to work with would have been helpful.

THe most difficult part of this project for me personally was getting the automation code chunk to run correctly.

Two of my biggest take aways from this project are: 1) Group work can be very pleasent when you have a good partner/group and 2) I am retaining more knowledge on coding in R than I've been giving myself credit for.
